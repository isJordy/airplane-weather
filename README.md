# Predictive Modeling of Flight Departure Delays Using Weather Data
## Objective
Utilizing flight data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2019, a predictive model will be created to determine if a departing flight will
experience delay, defined as a delay occuring 15 minutes or more after the scheduled departure time.

### Checkpoints
* Feb. 10 - Phase One: Imported data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations in order to briefly look and create a master datasets.

* Feb. 14 - Phase Two: Create visualiation of datasets in order profile the data.

* Mar. 23 - Phase Three: Research paper on methodolgies; no code needed.

* Apr. 24 - Phase Four: Develop models for formal project write up.

### Created for Rochester Institute of Technology capstone project.
